iven that integers are being read from a data stream. Find median of all the elements read so far starting from
the first integer till the last integer. This is also called Median of Running Integers

Algorithm:

    Create two heaps. One max heap to maintain elements of lower half and one min heap to maintain elements of higher half at 
    any point of time..
    Take initial value of median as 0.
    For every newly read element, insert it into either max heap or min heap and calulate the median based on the following 
    conditions:
        If the size of max heap is greater than size of min heap and the element is less
        than previous median then pop the top element from max heap and insert into min heap and insert the new 
        element to max heap else insert the new element to min heap. Calculate the new median as average of top of
        elements of both max and min heap.
        If the size of max heap is less than size of min heap and the element is greater than previous median then 
        pop the top element from min heap and insert into max heap and insert the new element to min heap else insert
        the new element to max heap. Calculate the new median as average of top of elements of both max and min heap.
        If the size of both heaps are same. Then check if current is less than previous median or not. If the current
        element is less than previous median then insert it to max heap and new median will be equal to top element
        of max heap. If the current element is greater than previous median then insert it to min heap and new median
        will be equal to top element of min heap.
